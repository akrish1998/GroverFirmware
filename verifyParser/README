python3 commandTestLooper.py

Only verifies the command loop, parser, and runner. Basically it ensures which commands
are sent where, and that invalid commands are handled nicely.

Does not verify actual functions:
stupidFuncs functions only prints which test should be run, the parameter details, and
a static, random encoder value
